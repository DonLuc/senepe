### Senepe
Senepe is a photo sharing Web application. The user can browse through a list of photos upon landing on the site. 
In the case the user wishes to share pictures, the user can register and login to do so. The aim of this project is to demonstrate Angular fundamentals as well as good programming standards. The back-end is developed in Spring boot (backend) and Angular 4 (frontend). 

### Requirements
1. Internet connection
2. Editor (WebStorm/Visual Studio Code) - ensure Editor is correctly configured to avoid linting issues.
3. Angular CLI should be installed (https://cli.angular.io)
4. NodeJS/npm should be installed (https://nodejs.org)
5. Knowledge of Terminal or CMD usage

### Setup

- ```git clone https://github.com/mrmodise/senepe.git```
- ``yarn install`` to install dependencies. 

The project was generated using ``angular CLI``, as such, providing ``ng serve -o`` should compile the project and open ln.

### State Management
Although this is an overkill for such a small application ``:)``, state is managed with Redux (https://github.com/angular-redux/store). Currently, this is a Work-in-progress (WIP).

### Unit Tests
```ng test``` to execute all unit tests. Currently all 70+ tests should execute.

Am busy finishing off the unit tests for all components and services. So far, these are "completed":

- LoginComponent
- RegisterComponent
- AddPhotoComponent
- PhotoListComponent
- AppComponent
- LoginService
- PhotoService

### End-to-end Tests
To execute e2e tests: ```ng e2e```. WIP

### Summary 

ยก`ng serve -o` for a dev server. App will open at `http://localhost:4200/`. 

For back-end code `cd backend` and `mvn package` to package the back-end code. ``java -jar target/senepe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`` to execute the back-end code. REST API launches on port 8088. All routes are secured excluding `/auth`

Completed modules: `registration`, `photo listing`, `login` and `photo uploading`.

`Note` project is still under development. Updated weekly

More refactoring to be done.....
