### Senepe
A photo sharing Web app developed in Spring boot (backend) and Angular 4 (frontend). 

### Setup
Clone the project to your preferred location and ``npm install`` to install dependencies. The project was generated using ``angular CLI``, as such, providing ``ng serve`` should run the project.

### Tests
Am busy finishing off the unit tests for all components and services. So far, these are completed:

- AppComponent
- AddPhotoComponent (WIP - work in progress)

### Summary 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

Run `mvn package` to execute the back-end code. REST API launches on port 8088. All routes are secured excluding `/auth`

`Note` project is still under development. Updated everyday `:)`

Completed modules: `registration`, `login` and `photo uploading`.

More refactoring to be done.....
